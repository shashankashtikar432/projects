One way of building image is to construct a docker file with docker commands

Another way of building the docker file is to start an image and build it manually
along the way commit changes to the image and build up on it.
e.g. 
Step 1: Start a new container by issuing following commands

docker run -ti --name=base-container ubuntu
Explaination: Starts a container with name base-container uses image named ubuntu to start the container

Step 2: Modify the container by issuing following
apt update && apt install -y nodejs

validate node.js installed in the container by issuing following commands
node -e 'console.log("Hello world!")'

Step 3: Commit the changes to the container by issuing 
docker container commit -m "Add node" base-container node-base

Command saves the current state of the container base-container as new image name node-base 
and adds text specified by -m flag as comment for the commit
